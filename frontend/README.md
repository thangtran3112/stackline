# Product Sale Reports

## Deployment

- AWS Cloudfront with s3

## Techstacks

- Material UI, Redux Toolkit, Tanstack React Query, Recharts

## Alternatives

- This could also be built using `tailwind` with headless ui libraries such as `ShadCnUI` instead of Material UI for better customizations.
- Instead of `@tanstack/react-query` we can also use RTK query or useSWR. @tanstack/react-query has more features and integrations, such as with [trpc](https://trpc.io/), and separate state management from api managements.

## Notes

- No Unit tests
